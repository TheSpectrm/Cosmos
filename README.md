## GitHub repository for Cosmos Engine
Cosmos is an in-development game engine, a project developed and made by Spectrm.
The engine is still in its early phases, so don't expect advanced features. 
It's had some basic stuff implemented, such as shaders and mathematics libraries.

More stuff will be added into the game engine as time goes on.
